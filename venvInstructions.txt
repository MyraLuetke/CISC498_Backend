Virtualenv lets us make sure that we're all running the code in the same environment so that 
there are no strange version issues.

To install:
pip install virtualenv
//Navigate to the root folder (CISC498_Backend)
virtualenv venv

To activate:
cd venv/Scripts // This is in the root folder
//For Windows:
activate.bat
//For Mac:
./activate

Command line should now look something like:
(venv) C:\Users\sammc\GitHub\CISC498\CISC498_Backend\backend>

To make sure all requirements are installed:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If some package is ever not installed:
pip install <package name>
pip freeze
// This should give some output such as 
asgiref==3.3.1
Django==3.1.5
djangorestframework==3.12.2
djangorestframework-simplejwt==4.6.0
PyJWT==2.0.1
pytz==2021.1
sqlparse==0.4.1
<new package>==<some version>

Add the <new package> line to requirements.txt
